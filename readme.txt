High-performance image generation using Stable Diffusion in KerasCV

In this guide, we will show how to generate novel images based on a text prompt using the KerasCV implementation of stability.ai's text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion.

Stable Diffusion is a powerful, open-source text-to-image generation model. While there exist multiple open-source implementations that allow you to easily create images from textual prompts, KerasCV's offers a few distinct advantages. These include XLA compilation and mixed precision support, which together achieve state-of-the-art generation speed.

In this guide, we will explore KerasCV's Stable Diffusion implementation, show how to use these powerful performance boosts, and explore the performance benefits that they offer.

To get started, let's install a few dependencies and sort out some imports:
